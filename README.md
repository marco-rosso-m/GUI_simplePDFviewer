# GUI_simplePDFviewer

![simplePDFviewer logo](https://github.com/marco-rosso-m/GUI_simplePDFviewer/blob/master/logo.png)

The current GUI App provides an initial simple PDF viewer developed in Python tkinter. The executable file has to be placed in the folder where we are interested. Firstly, when it runs, the App will compile the list of all PDF files which are present in the current folder. Thereafter, the first item is selected and the PDF files are shown on the right part of the window. Selecting another item, the app will display the newly selected PDF file. If any PDF is not present in the current folder, a message appears for the user informing that no PDF files have been found in the current folder.
